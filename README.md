#**This project which I creating for studying React and Redux course (TheNetNinja series)**
***

##React

*This will be updated super real quick pretty soon when completing this course* 
***
##Redux

1. Create **store** [object] (contains reducer)
2. Create **reducer** [function] (contains state - with initState & action)
3. Create **action** [object] (contains type and payload)
4. **Dispatch** (param: action)
5. **Subcribe** to changes (param: function which is fired everytime we make a change) 

####Notice:
- Do not access (use) directly the data inside the store (warehouse)
- Subcribe: f: return current state (use store.getState())
- Override all properties => should use ...state
